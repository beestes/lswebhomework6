# Homework #6

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* Functions
	A Function is a block of text that can be called upon to initiate an action. The block normally contains code that will perform a task when used within a page. Kind of like storing a phone number in your phone and using voice command or referencing it by the person's name to call that number.
	* Parameters
	Parameters are items that will be used within your function. They can be different values; numbers, variables, etc. Kind of like sending a group text to a few friends, you pick the ones who the message will go to.
	* Arguments
	Arguments are what your function will be checking. These can be set to numerous different values. They usually use the parameters to perform different actions that will lead you to what you want the function to output. Like real arguements, their purpose is to get to a solution.
	* `if` statements
	If statements give conditions for the function to follow. They allow the outcome of the funtion to change based on what is put in. Just like in life, if you perform an action, there can be multiple outcomes to it based on what the action is.

2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/

3. Download (clone) this project folder from GitHub.

4. Navigate into the downloaded folder using Terminal(Mac) or Command Prompt(Windows).  `ls`(Mac), `dir`(Windows) and `cd <directory_name>` are the commands you need to navigate around.

5. Once you are in the folder type the command `npm install`.  This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project.

6. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `exercises.js` to make the tests pass.
